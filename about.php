        <div class = 'about'>
          <p> Hi! Thanks for checking out my website - all entirely built in HTML and CSS
         (ok maybe a bit of PHP and Javascript, but no wordpress!).</p>
          <p> My goal is to share with you my experience as an entrepreneur, computer programmer, and life enthusiast.</p>
          <p> This is a (big) work in progress, and I welcome any comments you may have - feel free to reach out via my 
            <a href='http://joshaharonoff.com/contact'>Contact page. </a></p>
